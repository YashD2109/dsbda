# 1. Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 2. Load the dataset (Assume the dataset is in 'path_to_file.csv')
dataset_path = 'path_to_your_dataset.csv'  # Replace with the actual file path
df = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)

# 3. Scan the dataset and list the features and their types
print("Dataset Preview:\n", df.head())
print("\nFeature Types:")
print(df.dtypes)

# Features and their types:
# - Check the types of features based on the output of dtypes.
# - Numeric features: Continuous (e.g., age, income, etc.)
# - Categorical features: Nominal (e.g., species, gender, etc.)

# 4. Create histograms for each feature (numeric features)
df.hist(bins=20, figsize=(12, 8))
plt.suptitle('Histograms of Features')
plt.show()

# 5. Create boxplot for each feature
# Assuming all features except the categorical ones are numeric
sns.boxplot(data=df.select_dtypes(include='number'), orient="h")
plt.title('Box Plot of Features')
plt.show()

# 6. Identify outliers
# Outliers are visible as points outside the whiskers in the boxplot.
# Look for features with extreme values and check if they are part of a specific category (e.g., gender, species).
